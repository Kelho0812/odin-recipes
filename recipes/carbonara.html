    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>75g/2½ oz pancetta, chopped</li>
      <li>200g/7oz dried spaghetti</li>
      <li>2 large free-range eggs</li>
      <li>100g/3½oz Parmesan, grated, plus extra for serving</li>
      <li>1 tbsp full-fat milk (optional)</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the pancetta and
        cook until crisp and slightly browned. Remove the pan from the heat and
        set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the spaghetti
        and cook for 8–10 minutes, until firm but slightly chewy (al dente).
      </li>

      <li>
        While the spaghetti is cooking, beat together the eggs and Parmesan with
        a fork. If it's a little thick, add some milk. Season well with salt and
        pepper.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain over a bowl, reserving some of the
        cooking water.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place the frying pan with the pancetta in back over a medium–low heat.
        Add the drained spaghetti and egg mixture and stir thoroughly so all the
        spaghetti is coated in the sauce. Add 1–2 tablespoons of the reserved
        pasta water to loosen, if necessary. Serve immediately on hot plates
        with grated Parmesan on top.
      </li>
    </ol>
